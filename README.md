This project involved analyzing plant sales data to derive actionable insights and support decision-making through data visualization and reporting. The objective was to evaluate sales performance, track inventory 
levels, and identify trends to help optimize sales strategies.

    **Key Activities:**
    
    Data Collection & Cleaning: The project began by gathering plant sales data from various sources, including CSV files and Excel spreadsheets. Data cleaning techniques were applied in Excel using Power Query,    
    VLOOKUP, and pivot tables to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and transform raw data into an analyzable format.
    
    Sales Trend Analysis: Using Excel, key metrics such as total sales, sales per product category, and revenue per region were calculated. Historical sales trends were identified using time-series analysis, and 
    seasonality patterns were highlighted to predict future demand.
    
    Power BI Dashboards: Power BI was used to build dynamic, interactive dashboards for real-time reporting. Visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and heat maps were created to display sales performance, 
    product popularity, and geographic sales distribution.
    
    Data Modeling & DAX: Advanced data modeling techniques were applied in Power BI, with DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) used to create custom calculated measures for key performance indicators (KPIs) such as 
    sales growth, average order value, and profit margins.
    
    Automated Reporting & Insights: Reports were automated to refresh data on a scheduled basis, ensuring up-to-date sales performance data. The insights generated from the analysis were used to identify areas for 
    improvement, such as underperforming regions or products.
    
    Stakeholder Collaboration: The final deliverables were presented to the sales and marketing teams, providing them with clear visual insights and data-driven recommendations. These insights supported strategic 
    decisions, such as adjusting pricing strategies, optimizing inventory, and targeting specific customer segments, leading to a measurable increase in sales.
    
    The project effectively combined Excel for data manipulation and Power BI for advanced visualization and reporting, providing a comprehensive solution for understanding and optimizing plant sales operations.
